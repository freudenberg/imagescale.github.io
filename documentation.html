  <h2>Managing Automations</h2>
  <h3>Sign in</h3>
  <p>Once you have logged in with your username and password, you are
    on the automation screen.</p>
  <h3>Create new automation</h3>
  <p>Click <em>New Automation</em>. A new screen appears with various
  options. Let's set up an automation to scale and crop your
  images.</p>
  <p>First have a look at the two tables. The left hand table under
  the headline <strong>Actions</strong> allows you to compose your
  automation. The right hand table under the
  headline <strong>Palette</strong> contains the available actions.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Enter a label, e.g. "small-crop"</li>
    <li>In the Actions table find the row with the <em>Crop</em> action and
    remove it by clicking the button in the rightmost column of that row.</li>
    <li>Find the <em>ScaleAndCrop</em> action in the Palette table,
    click on the word <em>ScaleAndCrop</em> and drag it over the
    Actions table. Make sure to drop the action between
    the <em>Load</em> and <em>Render</em> actions. If it does not end
    up where it ought to be drag it around a bit.</li>
    <li><em>ScaleAndCrop</em> has some
    parameters: <em>width</em>, <em>height</em>, <em>yOffset</em>
    and <em>xOffset</em>. Enter some values for <em>xOffset</em>
    and <em>yOffset</em>, e.g. 20 and 50.</li>
    <li>Click the <em>Save<em> button.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Modify existing automation</h3>
  <p>Nowadays some images taken by smartphones store camera rotation
  data and if this is not taken into account the image might show up
  with an unintended rotation.</p>
  <p>ImageScale has an action for correcting this
  automatically: <em>AutoRotate</em>. You can add as many actions to
  an automation as you want. Beware, sometimes the order matters. All
  actions are executed in the order you place them in the table from
  top to bottom.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Drag the <em>AutoRotate</em> action from the Palette table to
    the Actions table. Make sure it is between <em>Load</em>
    and <em>Render</em>.</li>
    <li>Click the <em>Save<em> button.</li>
  </ol>
